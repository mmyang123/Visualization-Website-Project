## Project 3 Title : Visualization-Website-Project

_________________________________________________________________________

# **Overview**
- ### In Project 3, our group used two csv files of two different datasets, and . Both datasets needed ELT work done on it and then selected year 2010 for our project. We used pandas and extracted the tables from various sources, transformed and cleaned it and combined datasets to one dataframe. After that we loaded to PostgreSQL database to create a Schema table. The code in this repository showed the various ways the HTML, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and Flask server might all work together to support Project 3.

- ### Please create the repository to your desktop and clone it and then follow the instructions below.

 3. Push the above changes to GitHub.

 
 
 4. Open a GitBash (Window) or Terminal (Mac) to the *Visualization-Website-Project 3* repo, and activate *PythonData38* and type 'Jupyter Notebook' and hit Enter. to perform the ETL, and Pandas to load and converted DataFrame to Database.

 3. Once step two has completed, open PgAdmin to access PostgreSQL. Create a database called *AlcoholUnemployment_db*.

4. Open a query tool in the database, and then open the *Schema.sql* file from the repository.

5. Run the "create table" code.

6. Open up another terminal on the repository and activate 'Python
